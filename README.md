# Final notes
Please consider that often the main difference between neovim distros is their inner directory structure. This can make a big difference in maintaining your neovim distro. So take a look on how complex and well organized a distro is before cloning it.

Other things things to consider are:

* Philosophy behind the distro.
* How friendly the community is.
* How often is the issue tracker revised.

All distros listed here use the Lazy package manager.
